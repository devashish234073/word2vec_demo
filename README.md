Train and create a model using the datasets available in https://github.com/facebookresearch/llama-hd-dataset/tree/main/data

Download the two .tsv files from above location or just run word2vec_download.py to do the same.

Run "word2vec_train.py" to train the model.

Once trained run word2vec_run.py it will find similar words. 
The dimention of the vector is set in word2vec_train.py you can tweak that and train again to change it.
